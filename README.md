alicevie.space is my geminispace and gemlog, and extra files needed to run it.

I use [kineto](https://sr.ht/~sircmpwn/kineto/) to proxy my gemini server (running on [agate](https://github.com/mbrubeck/agate)) to http, and the style.css file in this repository imparts a decent theme onto the http site based on how my site looks in Lagrange.

site root is in site/

gemlog is managed through [gemlog.sh](https://git.sr.ht/~nytpu/gemlog.sh)
